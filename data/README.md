# Javascript data exercise 01

This exercise reads in a JavaScript variable that contains university lecturers' names in a JSON-like string of data and turns this string into a JavaScript object.

The code given only picks one of the lecturers' names. The exercise is to loop through them all, display the result on the HTML page, and apply some basic CSS syles.
